# Type compatibility
Type compatibility is very close to automatic or implicit type conversion. The type compatibility is being able to use two types together without modification and being able to subsititute one for the other without modification.

Compatible types are:
- `int` and `float`
- `int` and `double`
- `float` and `double`

Note: strings are not compatible with characters.
